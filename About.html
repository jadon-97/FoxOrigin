<div class="grid-item"><h2>Our Story</h2><br>
    <p> After years in the tech industry, we realized that it was near impossible for the average Jane or Joe to find solutions to their own problems. surfing the web contents for solutions was simply too complicated and time consuming.
        We created FoxOrigin with the user's perspective in mind. We wanted to offer a platform that would require no expert skills or tech experience. We keep it simple, so users can easily understand every step. Best of all - it's free. You can get online, showcase your problems, or start solving others problems right away.
        After seeing an increased need for software solutions, we developed one of the only fully-featured, free and commission-free online Community, allowing tech genuieses to publish their solution.
        Everyone deserves a blog, and we're excited to see what you come up with.</p></div>
<div class="grid-item"><h2>Our Values</h2><br>
    <p><h5>Every Individual Deserves a solution for their problem</h5></p>
            We believe every individual should have the power to solve their own problems. If you can guid them and help, you can make any person gain some experience in software which might help them come up with their own solutions.
    <p><h5>Our Customers Mean the World</h5></p>
            At FoxOrigin, we strive to provide exactly what our customers are looking for. A huge part of our brainstorming process is looking at our client feedback to make sure you're well taken care of.
